## Site Administrator
As a site administrator, the page should:

## Wireframe
The outcome from the Wireframes I made at the beginning has changed a bit from how the end product looked like. Nothing major, changed text-content placement etc. 
I also added the thanks-page which I didn't plan for when I made the wireframes:

## Design
### Colour scheme
- #000000
- #2B1A05
- #714C42
- #FAFAF8

![Color palette](assets/img_readme/gy_palette.png)

Color palette created using Canva.
The colors are very neutral with a lot of brown and beige colors, this is to match all the colors in the photos and let the photos "decorate" the site. 

### Font family
For the logo (made in Canva) I used ITC Avant Garde Gothic and Gothham.
For the rest of the site I used the linked Google Fonts with Poppins and the the fallback font is sans-serif. 
Bold was used mainly on the button texts with a weight of 900. 

## Future Features
- Making the images on the Gallery page clickable to either enlarge the picture or find more information. 
- Making an add to cart for user to purchase already finished products or patterns.
