## About Gigis Yarn
Gigis Yarn is designed to act like a gallery for my crochet artwork. On the site you will find handmade baby toys and accessories, these items can also be customized and purchased. 

The site features a clear and simpel design that includes a navbar at the top next to the logo. In the navbar there is a menu (burger-menu for mobile-devices and buttons for other larger devices) with three buttons â€“ Home, Photos and Contact. There is also a footer containing working icons of Facebook, Instagram and Contact.  

Homepage: Contains a description of Gigis Yarn. 
Photos: Shows photos of my previous works. 
Contact: A form to contact me.

## Wireframe
The outcome from the Wireframes I made at the beginning has changed a bit from how the end product looked like. Nothing major, changed text-content placement etc.
