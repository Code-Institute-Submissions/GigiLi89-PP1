## About Gigis Yarn
Gigis Yarn is designed to act like a gallery for my crochet artwork. On the site you will find handmade baby toys and accessories, these items can also be customized and purchased. 

The site features a clear and simpel design that includes a navbar at the top next to the logo. In the navbar there is a menu (burger-menu for mobile-devices and buttons for other larger devices) with three buttons â€“ Home, Photos and Contact. There is also a footer containing working icons of Facebook, Instagram and Contact.  

Homepage: Contains a description of Gigis Yarn. 
Photos: Shows photos of my previous works. 
Contact: A form to contact me.

## Design

### Colour scheme
- #AD795B

![Color palette][assets/images/color_palette.png]
Color palette created using Canva.
The colors are very neutral with a lot of brown and beige colors, this is to match all the colors in the photos and let the photos "decorate" the site. 

### Font family
For the logo (made in Canva) I used ITC Avant Garde Gothic and Gothham.
For the rest of the site I used the linked Google Fonts with Poppins and the the fallback font is sans-serif. 
Bold was used mainly on the button texts with a weight of 900.
