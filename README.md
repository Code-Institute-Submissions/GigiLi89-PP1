![Color palette][assets/img_readme/gy_palette.png]

Color palette created using Canva.
The colors are very neutral with a lot of brown and beige colors, this is to match all the colors in the photos and let the photos "decorate" the site. 

### Font family
For the logo (made in Canva) I used ITC Avant Garde Gothic and Gothham.
For the rest of the site I used the linked Google Fonts with Poppins and the the fallback font is sans-serif. 
Bold was used mainly on the button texts with a weight of 900.

## Wireframe
The outcome from the Wireframes I made at the beginning has changed a bit from how the end product looked like. Nothing major, changed text-content placement etc. 

## W3C Validator
Tested 2023-03-01, result: 
### Index page
- Could not have an <a> as a decendant to <button>. This was solved by putting only an a href-tag ad styling it. 
- Changed my <section> to <div> since I'm not using a header and only h2.
### Gallery page
- Same issue with the button since I used the same code. 
- Changed my <section> to <div> since I'm not using a header and only h2.
- I had a <div> without a closing tag
### Contact page
- Changed my <section> to <div> since I'm not using a header and only h2. 
### Thanks page
- <button> issue and <section> issue, the same as the other pages. 

### CSS Stylesheet
- Forgot to put px after a unit

All issues has been taken care of and there are no more errors or warnings. 

2023-03-02: Tested the site again after testing it on Lighthouse, no errors were found. 

## Lighthouse testing
2023-03-02, result: 

### Mobile version:
![Lighthouse result Mobile](assets/img_readme/lighthouse_result.png)

After the first run I had some errors on the Performance (70) and Accessibility (82). 

My first choice of color was a lighter brown (#AD795B) combined with a back font color. I used a color contrast tool (linked in my sources) and picked a slightly darker brown (#714C42)with a white font color instead. I also changed the logo to the same brown to match the rest of the site, this I did in Canva since I designed the logo myself. 

After those changes my Accessibility came up to 100. 

My Performance was still on 70 and Lighthouse recommended to change my images from png to webp, which I did using a converter (also linked in my sources). This made my Performance board to go up to 75. Main problem is still my header/hero image.

### Desktop version:
![Lighthouse result Desktop](assets/img_readme/lighthouse_resultdesk.png)

The desktop came back with a better result. The Performance is still not where I want it to be but 85 is better than the mobile versions 75. I ran the mobile version and fixed the errors the best I could. This most likely has effected the results for the desktop results as I ran that after.
